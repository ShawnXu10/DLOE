# Discrete Laplace Operator Estimation for Dynamic 3D Reconstruction

We present a general paradigm for dynamic 3D reconstruction from multiple independent and uncontrolled image sources having arbitrary temporal sampling density and distribution.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/ShawnXu10/DLOE_dynamic_3D_reconstruction.git
```
### Prerequisites

Linux, matlab

## Running the tests

Run demo.m for a quick demo
Run test.m to test the improvment of reconstruction by more accurate reconstruction

## Publication

Please read [Discrete Laplace Operator Estimation for Dynamic 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11044.pdf) for details implementation.
